				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3953485/chapters/8864386" target="_blank"> Never Looked Better</a> — por_queeee
				<p>"It was really kind of surprising how easy it was to escape the hell of Pandora just by saying 'hey, I’ve got our insane/dead CEO lodged in my fucking brain! Wanna have a look?'"<br>Turns out that Jack's not so dead anymore. Turns out that he has more than a passing interest in Rhys for some weird reason.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5797366" target="_blank"> of stars and other precious things</a> — lasciel
				<p>Jack is one half of a notorious and ageing adventurer duo looking for a vault. <br>Rhys — the popular reporter hired to film the entire journey — just wants to do his job, thank you very much.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/33730555" target="_blank"> A Demonstration in Equilibrium</a> — comete
				<p>Rhys was tired of running. His heart pounded like the beat of a tribal drum. Thudding, thudding, thudding. Blood coursed through his ears and muffled his audio intake, but even then he could not drown out the sound of a dead man’s voice. It echoed through the speakers of multiple surveyor bots that searched for Rhys. The loud volume boomed out the angry, coaxing voice of Handsome Jack.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5212514" target="_blank"> The Plastic King of Castle Polyethylene</a> — jettiebettie
				<p>[He stares] with sunken eyes at the slow pulsating glow of the iris. It’s grown dimmer, the remaining stored energy finally beginning to run out after days (weeks?) of being in Rhys’s pocket. It probably has a few days left on its own like this, five at most. It’s hard not to think of the man (AI, artificial intelligence, malicious code, not a man, not a man, get a hold of yourself) who begged for his life.<br>On his knees.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25064002/chapters/60707422" target="_blank"> I'm choosing my confessions.</a> — ladymdc
				<p>It would be extremely high-risk, but it would be worth it. It would be worth getting closer to Handsome Jack.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/30766997" target="_blank"> Worship</a> — vargrimar
				<p>Patience is not a virtue Jack keeps in spades, but when it comes to this, its font is fathomless.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36944023" target="_blank"> Twist the Knife</a> — Ukarimo
				<p>Rhys looks upon Jack with contempt, something so foreign to the powerful man these days. It only adds to the fire of desire curling in his gut. What’s that saying? Something about people always wanting what they can’t have. But now he has him, doesn't he? Atlas’ untouchable CEO…now sitting on Jack’s lap, exposed and practically begging to be touched. Jack’s not going to let this opportunity pass. Internal affairs be damned. He can deal with that later, after he’s fucked this perfectly composed man into next week.<br>Jack can still hold onto reasonable doubt. Doubt over whether the sharp man before him is really behind the corporate espionage. Until he is sure he might as well withhold that line of thought and have a little fun. Besides, this is Atlas. He’s crushed the company before. How much of a difference could this fresh CEO make?</p></li>

				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/16811332/chapters/39460216" target="_blank"> if you have a taste of silver, pennies won't do</a> — callmearcturus
				<p>There are a lot of good reasons why Rhys will not sleep with Handsome Jack. He even makes a list.<br>Sending the list to Jack is his first mistake, but by no means his last.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5264774/chapters/12148142" target="_blank"> repertoire</a> — callmearcturus
				<p>Honey, blood, and gunmetal: To make it in the corporate world, you need an abundance.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5629420" target="_blank"> Young God</a> — sarkywoman
				<p>Rhys finds himself drawn into a power more intoxicating than the one he was born with. Torn between two lives, he struggles to remember who has earned his loyalty.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/32289478" target="_blank"> The Way Down</a> — ladymdc
				<p>Avoiding catching Jack’s attention had been the only logical thing to do, the only rational thing. But Rhys had weighed his options and deemed Jack worth the risk repeatedly over the years. Even after his DNA itself had been permanently and irreversibly altered as a result, Rhys still chose him.<br>The value of that was not lost on Jack, and he had no interest in losing it. Not when he didn’t have to.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/37082053" target="_blank"> I call and I can hear you sing, but oh, it’s only my echo</a> — Lost_Elf
				<p>Seeing that his boyfriend was asleep, Rhys allowed himself to undo the first couple buttons of his flannel pyjama shirt. He claimed that he was always cold, and it was partially true, but the main reason why he always wore such thick clothes to bed, even though his boyfriend was a living, walking furnace, was that in his sleep, he couldn’t control the flicker of his tattoos. Even now, they took a while to stop emitting a low glow after they were brought alive by the nightmare.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/24487165" target="_blank"> Kill Your Love For Greater Good, Use His Corpse For Fun</a> — Lost_Elf
				<p>The New-U have a glitch only known to few people. If there is a delay between the death and the reincarnation, the new body will take longer to wake, and the user will have no memory of their death and some time prior to that. Handsome Jack takes advantage of that, but only to protect Rhys, really.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5432816" target="_blank"> man's best friend</a> — lasciel
				<p>Rhys weighs every aspect of himself carefully before sharing it with his employees. Has to, even if outsiders do not see it, much less understand it.<br>A long time ago, Rhys drew a line; over metal, unforgiving pandoran sand and the bodies of those who thought he shouldn't be — couldn't be — at the top simply for what he was.<br>He deliberately skirts that line sometimes, crosses it even when the situation calls for it, but it's still a constant in his life.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4830131" target="_blank"> Coming In Unannounced</a> — michaelandthegodsquad
				<p>"The lack of agency is. What I'm really looking for. Just. Having it taken from me. The complete loss of control."<br>Jack nods, looking fully back at him. "And you're sure you trust me to do it, Rhys?"<br>Rhys sits stock still, eyes wide and dark and shining—Jack could do anything to him in that time, not just what he’s asking for, could give or take whatever he wanted and Rhys wouldn’t be able to do a thing about it, but still—"Yes," he says, quietly but clearly. "Yeah, Jack. I trust you."</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25112374" target="_blank"> Sit Tight</a> — vargrimar
				<p>“So, why the automated message? Couldn’t you have just, I don’t know, sent a quick, ‘Hey, get up here’? It’s not like you haven’t done it before.”<br>“Oh, believe me, I would’ve if that had even been a friggin’ option. But, uh. Well.” Jack laughs, incredulous and—a little exasperated? “I’m kind of in a bind here, kitten.”<br>Or: in which trust is a funny thing and goes both ways.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13380750/chapters/30646299" target="_blank"> tomorrow is not promised (but tonight is on the table)</a> — ThirtySixSaveFiles
				<p>Ask anyone and they can tell you the story: that the words inked on your skin are the first words that your soulmate will say to you. That if you are in the right place at the right time, if you’re lucky, you’ll find the person made to complement you in every way.<br>It’s easy to see why people want to believe it. The notion of a perfect partner is seductive, and some people spend their entire lives searching.<br>Most people don’t beat the odds - and with humanity spread from the central planets to the farthest-flung outpost, the odds are pretty astronomical. A reasonable amount of basic compatibility and a visit to a decent tattooist are enough to satisfy tradition, for most people.<br>The Hyperion president loudly, publicly, does not believe in that bullshit. The Atlas president keeps his counsel to himself.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3983149" target="_blank"> routine</a> — callmearcturus
				<p>In which Rhys is on Hyperion’s payroll as Jack’s “secretary.” Well, he does spend his time in the CEO’s office, that much is true.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/30787685" target="_blank"> Guarantees</a> — vargrimar
				<p>“How’s it going, Atlas?”<br>Better, Rhys doesn’t say. After hours aside, this is still intergalactic chess.<br>“What do you want, Jack?”<br>In which two long-standing rivals finally come to an accord.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5675203" target="_blank"> Winner</a> — jackassai
				<p>In these quiet moments, it could almost seem like they cared for each other. The truth is, it’s all about winning.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5135012" target="_blank"> Addiction</a> — jackassai
				<p>Sometimes the Hyperion CEO Handsome Jack and the Atlas CEO Rhys aren’t trying to kill each other. Sometimes they meet up to satisfy a mutual addiction they share.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4616631" target="_blank"> call it what you want</a> — callmearcturus
				<p>In which Rhys is President, Jack is everything, and that beautiful chair gets used as intended.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4633797" target="_blank"> Not Coincidence (but providence)</a> — verulams
				<p>Rhys is plugged into the ECHOnet.<br>It goes like this: First, there is everything. And then there is nothing at all. There is always Jack, though. There's always Jack.</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item -->

				<!-- fanfic item -->
				<li class="mb-3"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/28382868" target="_blank"> To Take Care Of</a> — sparxwrites
				<p>Grinning wide, Jack slowly raised one translucent, triumphant hand – and a naked sort of terror crawled its way across Rhys’ face as his own, mechanical hand lifted too.<br>It settled heavy on his collarbone, cold fingertips grazing the softness of his neck just enough for him to feel his own pulse racing below fragile skin. “I can rip your throat out for real, now, princess,” Jack whispered, teeth bared into something too hungry, too animal to be described as a smile, voice a low rumble. “Isn’t that fun?”<br>(In which Rhys gets threatened, gets choked, and gets himself off. in no particular order; or, rather, somewhat simultaneously.)</p></li>
				<!-- fanfic item last -->
				<li><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25340926" target="_blank"> I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream </a> — Lost_Elf
				<p> Jack groans in discomfort. Or tries to. The air barely passes through his throat in the right way, and no sound is let out of his mouth. He reaches up to his throat, that also feels wrong – and fortunately, he is not tied to the bed, because that would be a real cliché – and massages it. Wrong.<br>He tries to make another sound, speak, cough, whistle. And that is when he finally notices.<br>Jack’s hands shoot up to his face, searching, touching, but it just, it just isn’t there! He has no mouth. And no voice cords, probably, but he has no mouth, and how is he going to speak, eat, live, oh God—<br>Panic is almost new to Handsome Jack. He claws at his face, forcibly tries to move his jaw, but it doesn’t budge.</p></li>
